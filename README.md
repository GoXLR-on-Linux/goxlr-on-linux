Documentation and scripts to make the GoXLR and GoXLR Mini useful on Linux.

- All of the output and input channels are available (System, Chat, Music, ...)
- The Faders work
- The bleep button (`!@#$?*`) works
- The Mute buttons DO NOT WORK
- The Sampler buttons DO NOT WORK
- The Effects buttons DO NOT WORK
- The Cough button DOES NOT WORK

And also, you do still need a Windows with the official GoXLR App to initialize the GoXLR **everytime it loses power**!
That means either passing it through to a VM, or dual-booting.

## Requirements

### Linux Kernel >= 5.11.x
Older kernels technically work, but most people experience a lot of audio stutter and skipping on older kernels.

### PulseAudio
A lot of Linux distributions ship with PulseAudio by default.

### JACK2 and pulseaudio-module-jack
The required packages are installed during the installation

## Installation

#### Download the `install.sh` script, and execute it:
This command must be executed in the console. You also need curl installed to use it. To do this, open the terminal, paste the following line and press enter:
```
curl -fsSL https://github.com/GoXLR-on-Linux/goxlr-on-linux/raw/main/install.sh | bash
```
The script should request your configuration and save it.

## Usage
If you've set the script to run on startup, everything should work out of the box.


### IMPORTANT


> This script only works if the GoXLR is not turned off after a profile has been loaded in Windows. The GoXLR Mini, which is powered through USB, will lose it's configuration when you reboot unless you plug it into a port that ALWAYS supplies power (even when the system is turned off or reboots).

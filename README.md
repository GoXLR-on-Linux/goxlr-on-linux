## Status
As of 2024 [basic functionality](https://github.com/GoXLR-on-Linux/goxlr-on-linux/wiki/Basic-Functionality) of the GoXLR is available
in all major distributions. To prevent confusion, the scripts which were originally housed here have been removed. This repository is
being preserved for general FAQs and support, and our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Wbp3UxkX2j) server will remain available for discussion!

## The [GoXLR Utility](https://github.com/GoXLR-on-Linux/goxlr-utility/)
While the GoXLR works out the box, an application is still required to initialise and configure it. For that we have
the GoXLR Utility, a 1:1 replacement for the Official Windows GoXLR Application. It is feature complete, stable,
and has binaries provided for various distributions. 


## Known Issues
Below are a list of currently known issues, with links to wiki pages on how to solve them.
